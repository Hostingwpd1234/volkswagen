<h3><p>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in
1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for
their design beauty and numerous race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", 
the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.<br><br>
Bugatti cars were extremely successful in racing. The little Bugatti Type 10 swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 
Bugatti Type 35 is one of the most successful racing cars - developed by Bugatti with master engineer and racing driver Jean Chassagne who 
also drove it in the car's first ever Grand Prix in 1924 Lyon. Bugattis swept to victory in the Targa Florio for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. 
Louis Chiron held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the modern marque revival Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. named the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron 
concept car in his honour. But it was the final racing success at Le Mans that is most remembered, Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one car and 
meagre resources.<br><br>

<h3>Pre-Veyron</h3>
<p>Volkswgan Group acquired the Bugatti brand in 1998. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign to 
produce Bugatti Automobiles's first concept vehicle, the EB118, a coupé that debuted at the 1998 Paris Auto Show. The EB118 concept 
featured a 408-kilowatt (555 PS; 547 bhp), W-18 engine. After its Paris debut, the EB118 concept was shown again in 1999 at the Geneva Auto Show and the Tokyo Motor Show. Bugatti introduced its next concepts, the EB 218 at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show and the 18/3 Chiron at the 1999 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA).</p>
<h3>Veyron era (2005–2015)</h3>
<p>Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. began assembling its first regular-production vehicle, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 (the 1001 PS super car with an 8-litre W-16 engine with four turbochargers) in September 2005 at the Bugatti Molsheim, France assembly "studio".[16][17] On 23 February 2015, 
Bugatti sold its last Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse, which was named La Finale.</p>

<h3>Chiron era (2016–present)</h3>
<p>The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engined, two-seated sports car, designed by Achim Anscheidt,[19] developed as the successor to the 
Bugatti Veyron.[20] The Chiron was first revealed at the Geneva Motor Show on March 1, 2016.[21][22]
In February 2024, Bugatti announced the successor to the Chiron, which will use a V16 hybrid-electric powertrain.[23]</p>

<u><h2>BUGATTI CHIRON:</h2></u>

<h3><p>This Bugatti is one of the most beautiful cars ever built. This race car is a two-seater mid-engine luxury car with a top speed of 261 mph and 
a price tag of $2.4 million. Just 450 units of the 2016 Chiron were produced due to its rarity.
In addition, the Chiron is a conceptual marvel. It has a similar appearance and form to the notorious Veyron 16.4, but with a few key differences,
such as L.E.D. headlights, sharp edges, a redesigned interior, and a more powerful grille. Overall, 
the Chiron blends the best features of the Veyron 16.4 while still building on them in key ways.</p></h3>

<u><h2>BUGATTI VEYRON:</h2></u>

<h3><p>April 28, 2015: Bugatti, originally French and now owned by Volkswagen group is oiling up its Veyron successors named as Chiron. 
Reports say that this all new car hypercar will do 0-100 kmph in just 2 seconds. Bugatti is expected to use the W16 8.0 litre engine from the Veyron 
that may produce more than 1500 PS and will add to the Formula1 car beating performance. The torque is believed to remain 1500 Nm but it will be coming in 
at a lower rpm than the current car. Moreover, Chiron could even be a hybrid as it’s name indicates towards a mythical animal, half human and half horse.</p></h3>

<h3><p>The Bugatti Divo is powered by the same eight-litre quad-turbo W16 engine which also propels the Chiron and puts out a whopping 1500PS of peak power and
 is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. While its predecessors, the Veyron and the Chiron managed a top speed of 400+ kmph, the Divo is capable of 380 kmph.
However, the Bugatti Divo is meant to deliver better performance on the track. It has already proved its credentials by being 8 seconds faster than the 
Chiron on the Nardo handling circuit in Italy.</p></h3>

<h3><p> Bugatti is celebrating its presence at the 2019 Pebble Beach Concourse with a modern incarnation of the hypercar which put the French  brand on the world map for the first time – the EB110.  Called the Centodieci, the Chiron-based homage to the EB110 will be produced in limited
numbers – 10 to be precise – with each costing a whopping 8 million Euros (which approximately translates to Rs 64 crore).  The Centodieci – which translates to 110 in Italian – has several design elements which are a direct nod to the EB110. This includes the smaller Bugatti 
 ‘horse-shoe’ grille, horizontal louvres for front air intake, wrap-around windscreen on the near-absent A-pillar and a five-aperture side air intake behind 
 the doors. Like the Divo that was shown at Pebble Beach last year, the Centodieci is drop-dead gorgeous as well. </p></h3>

<h3><p>The Bugatti La Voiture Noire is an upcoming C2-segment Sedan with seating for up to 2 occupants. We expect the new La Voiture Noire to launch by 
April 2025. When the upcoming Bugatti La Voiture Noire goes on sale, we expect it to cost between Rs. 132.00 Cr and Rs. 160.00 Cr.The La Voiture Noire 
could come with the following 1 engine-transmission combinations.The La Voiture Noire is an ultra-rare car designed to celebrate 110 years of Bugatti's 
existence. And, as it turns out, it is fitting for the purpose. Between its powerful engineering, elegant design, sophisticated technology, and spectacular
 luxury, the La Voiture Noire is without equal and competently demonstrates the immense reputation of the Bugatti brand.</p></h3>

<u><h2>BUGATTI  BOLIDE:</h2></u>

<h3><p>Behold! Bugatti has unveiled the finalised interior for its track-only Bolide hypercar, due in 2024. Spoiler alert: it’s very blue and very tech-heavy.
To begin with, Bugatti says the all-new, lightweight monocoque is “stronger and stiffer” than the Chiron's. The new tub that’s emerged as a result has 
led to a much flatter driving position which leans backwards into the rear section of the car - something that’s often seen in hardcore racing cars.
The Bolide’s outer ‘X-theme’ has also been continued inside, as evidenced by the nerd-fest steering wheel. It has been created using 3D polygonal modelling,
 which is what developers from the gaming and visual effects industries use to refine their work.</p></h3>
